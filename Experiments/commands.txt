python -u fine_tune.py x y z


'-u' was sometimes necessary for the MPI to print cycle updates when running multiple workers

'x y z' are the indices of the permutation to run, any number of them works

tweak setting acording to HPC shanenigans, set number of episodes to evaluate on in script





python -u run_experiment.py [some_string] [model_name] --div [bool]

'some_str is used in the experiments_log.txt'
'model_name' from choices in the arg
--div sets the devision by advantage, available for all models

set the defaults based on HPC shenanigans and hyperparameter finetuning results
